<h1>Ozymandias</h1>
<!-- Poet's Name -->
<h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
<!-- Poem -->
<p>
I met a traveller from an antique land,<br />
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br />
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br />
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br />
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br />
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br />
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br />
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<br />
</p>
